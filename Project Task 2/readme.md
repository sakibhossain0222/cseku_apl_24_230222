# Railway Management System (RRMS)

## Project Overview
The **Railway Management System (RRMS)** is a Java-based project designed to simulate essential functionalities in a railway reservation and management system. This project adheres strictly to the **SOLID principles** of software design to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The system includes features like ticket booking, ticket cancellation, passenger management, and report generation, demonstrating the effective use of object-oriented principles.

## Features
1. **Booking Service**: Enables passengers to book and cancel tickets.
2. **Passenger Management**: Manages and stores information about passengers.
3. **Payment Processing**: Allows for secure payment processing for bookings.
4. **Report Generation**: Generates various reports such as booking reports and revenue reports.

## Class Overview

### Core Classes
- **Main**: The entry point of the application, used to demonstrate booking a ticket, adding passengers, and processing payments.
- **RailwayService**: Coordinates ticket booking and payment processing by integrating multiple services.
- **PassengerRepository**: Manages a list of passengers and allows adding and retrieving passenger data.
- **PassengerTrain**: Represents a passenger train, implementing the `ITrain` interface with schedule and route details.

### Services and Interfaces
- **BookingService** (Interface): Defines the contract for booking and cancellation services.
    - `TicketBooking`: Implements ticket booking functionality.
    - `TicketCancellation`: Implements ticket cancellation functionality.
- **PassengerService** (Interface): Defines the methods for adding and retrieving passenger data.
- **PaymentProcessor** (Interface): Outlines payment processing methods.
    - `CreditCardPayment`: Simulates credit card payment processing.
- **ReportGenerator** (Interface): Outlines methods for generating reports.
    - `BookingReport`: Generates reports on ticket bookings.
    - `RevenueReport`: Generates reports on revenue collected.

## SOLID Principles Used

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class in this project has a single responsibility, such as managing bookings or handling payments.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: New functionality, such as adding a new type of report, can be implemented without modifying existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Classes that implement interfaces, like `ITrain`, can replace each other without affecting functionality.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Specific interfaces like `BookingService` and `PaymentProcessor` ensure that classes only implement necessary methods.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The `RailwayService` class depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations for flexibility.
